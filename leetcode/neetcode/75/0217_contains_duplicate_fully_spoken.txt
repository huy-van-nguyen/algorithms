ðŸŽ¤ Contains Duplicate â€“ Interview Style (Python Version)

Alright, let me walk you through my solution for the Contains Duplicate problem from LeetCode.

Step 1 â€“ Understand the Problem

We're given an array of integers, and the goal is to determine if any number appears more than once.

If there is at least one duplicate, we return True.
If all elements are unique, we return False.

Step 2 â€“ Brute Force Idea

The brute-force approach would be to compare every element with every other one.
That would require two nested loops and take Big O of n squared time â€” which is not ideal for large arrays.

Step 3 â€“ Optimal Approach

To improve this, I use a set to track what numbers we've seen so far.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
- Initialize an empty set called seen.
- Loop through each number in the input list.
- If the number is already in the seen set, we return True.
- Otherwise, we add the number to the set and continue.
- If we finish the loop without finding any duplicate, we return False.

Since checking membership and adding to a set both take constant time on average,
the total time complexity is Big O of n â€” linear time.

Step 4 â€“ Walkthrough with Example

Letâ€™s say the input is [1, 2, 3, 1]:

- Start with an empty set
- First number is 1 â†’ not in the set â†’ add it
- Second is 2 â†’ not in the set â†’ add it
- Third is 3 â†’ not in the set â†’ add it
- Fourth is 1 â†’ already in the set â†’ return True

Step 5 â€“ Time and Space Complexity

Time complexity: Big O of n  
We go through the list once, and set operations are constant time.

Space complexity: Big O of n  
In the worst case, if all numbers are unique, we store n elements in the set.

Step 6 â€“ Edge Cases

- If the input list is empty, we return False â€” because there are no elements, so no duplicates.
- If the input list has only one element, we also return False.
- If all elements are the same, we return True.

Step 7 â€“ Summary

This solution is efficient, easy to implement, and works well in practice.
Using a set gives us a clean Big O of n time solution.
